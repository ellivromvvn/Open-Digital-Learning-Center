\subsection{Rationale}\label{rationale}}

In line with the vision of Nueva Vizcaya State University (NVSU), the
College of Teacher Education (CTE) aims to produce relevant world class
teachers, research projects, and extension programs to meet the demand
of 21st century education. To help the college achieve these noble
goals, the establishment of the Educational Technology Center (ETC) is
proposed. The ETC will serve as a hub for collaborative, innovative, and
interactive learning experiences that utilize state of the art
educational technologies. It will serve as a research and development,
training and extension center for educational technology.

In the article entitled ``Long Waves: The History of Innovation
Cycles,'' Neufeld (2022) explains that we are now transitioning from the
fifth wave to the sixth wave of innovation. The sixth wave of innovation
is also known as the fourth industrial revolution (Schwab, 2016). As
explained by Neufeld (2022), the transition is from digital networks,
software, and new media to digitization (AI, IoT, AV, Robots, and
Drones) and clean tech. These developments have created a demand for
21st-century skills from graduates in both basic and tertiary education.
These changes are revolutionizing education all over the world.

In response, the education sector in the country implemented significant
changes in the education system. One significant change in the basic
education curriculum is the implementation of K to 12 by the Department
of Education (DepEd). On the other hand, the Commission on Higher
Education (CHED) revised the higher education curriculum in 2017, making
it outcomes-based and aligning it with the K to 12 curriculum.

The curriculum revision done by CHED resulted to the following program
outcomes for teacher education: a) Articulate the rootedness of
education in philosophical, socio-cultural, historical, psychological,
and political contexts b) Demonstrate mastery of subject
matter/discipline c) Facilitate learning using a wide range of teaching
methodologies and delivery modes appropriate to specific learners and
their environments d) Develop innovative curricula, instructional plans,
teaching approaches, and resources for diverse learners e) Apply skills
in the development and utilization of ICT to promote quality, relevant,
and sustainable educational practices f) Demonstrate a variety of
thinking skills in planning, monitoring, assessing, and reporting
learning processes and outcomes g) Practice professional and ethical
teaching standards sensitive to the local, national, and global
realities h) Pursue lifelong learning for personal and professional
growth through varied experiential and field-based opportunities.

open ICT in education and teacher education, open distance learning
(ODL), open educational resources (OERs), AI and data science in
education and teacher education, reproducible research, and the use of
technology to better understand students' learning process from
pre-school to graduate school (\emph{{U}{C}{I} {D}{L}{L} ---
Digitallearninglab.org}). It will also serve as a hub for training and
extension programs on the said topics. Open and collaboration will be
the overall theme.

The proposal is inspired by the Digital Learning Lab of the University
of California, Irvine (\emph{{U}{C}{I} {D}{L}{L} ---
Digitallearninglab.org}). In their website, they have the slogans
``Transform teaching and learning with innovative research in
educational technology'' and ``Motivate students to learn with best
practices in digital learning''.

\hypertarget{legal-framework}{%
\subsection{Legal Framework}\label{legal-framework}}

Open distance learning (ODL) is the future. RA 10650 of 2014, also known
as the Open Distance Learning Act, supports the institutionalization of
ODL for tertiary education and offers funding. RA 11448 of 2019, also
known as the Transnational Higher Education Act (TNHE) defined open
distance learning (ODL) as one of the modes of TNHE. The ODOLC will be a
center for research and development of ODL platforms and OERs.

To make the curriculum outcomes-based, in 2017, the Commission on Higher
Education (CHED) revised the higher education curriculum. The curriculum
of the programs offered in CTE were revised and the courses Technology
for Teaching and Learning (TTL) 1 and 2 are professional education and
major courses respectively required in each program (Commission on
Higher Education, 2017b, 2017d, 2017g, 2017f, 2017e, 2017c, 2017a).
These subjects require computer laboratories. Further more, some major
courses of some programs (ex. BSEd Mathematics; geometry, calculus, and
statistics subjects, etc.) need computer laboratories. The ODOLC will
serve as a computer laboratory for these courses. It will help improve
the curriculum and make it 21st century ready.

On the other hand, the importance and necessity of open digital and
online learning can never be understated during the COVID pandemic.
During the pandemic, the use of open digital and online media in the
teaching and learning process became relevant. It greatly facilitated
the implementation of flexible learning (Commission on Higher Education,
2020).

Moreover, RA 11927 of 2022, also know as the Philippine Digital
Workforce Competitiveness ACT, promotes and supports the development of
human resources that are equipped with digital skills and competencies
that are comparable with global standards. The CTE with the proposed
ODOLC can greatly contribute to this cause. Graduates of CTE will be
equipped with digital skills. These digitally competitive teachers will
promote digital literacy in the basic education.

science in education and teacher education, reproducible research, and
the use of open technology to understand students' learning process from
pre-school to graduate school.
