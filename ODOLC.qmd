## Brief Description

::: {style="text-align: justify"}
In line with the vision of Nueva Vizcaya State University (NVSU), the College of Teacher Education (CTE) aims to produce **relevant world class teachers, research projects, and extension programs** to meet the demand of **21st century education**. To help the college achieve these noble goals, the establishment of the **Open Digital and Online Learning Center (ODOLC)** is proposed.
:::

> A premier university in a global community.

::: {style="text-align: justify"}
The ODOLC will serve as a hub for [**open, collaborative, innovative, and interactive learning experiences**]{style="color:blue;"} that utilize state of the art open digital and online learning technology in various forms.

It will also serve as a research and development center for **open educational technology, open ICT in education and teacher education, open distance learning (ODL), open educational resources (OERs), AI and data science in education and teacher education, reproducible research, and the use of technology to better understand students' learning process from pre-school to graduate school** [@dll]. It will also serve as a hub for training and extension programs on the said topics.

The proposal is inspired by the Digital Learning Lab of the University of California, Irvine [@dll]. In their website, they have the slogans **"Transform teaching and learning with innovative research in educational technology""** and **"Motivate students to learn with best practices in digital learning"**.

# Legal Framework

## 

::: {style="text-align: justify"}
Open distance learning (ODL) is the future. RA 10650 of 2014, also known as the [**Open Distance Learning Act**]{style="color:blue;"}, supports the institutionalization of ODL for tertiary education and offers funding. RA 11448 of 2019, also known as the [**Transnational Higher Education Act (TNHE)**]{style="color:blue;"} defined open distance learning (ODL) as one of the modes of TNHE. The ODOLC will be a center for research and development of [**ODL platforms and OERs**]{style="color:blue;"}.
:::

## 

::: {style="text-align: justify"}
To make the curriculum outcomes-based, the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) revised the higher education curriculum. The curriculum of the programs offered in CTE were revised and the courses **Technology for Teaching and Learning 1 and 2 are professional education and major courses required in each program** [@CMO_74_17; @CMO_75_17; @CMO_76_17; @CMO_78_17; @CMO_79_17; @CMO_80_17; @CMO_82_17]. **These subjects require computer laboratories**. Further more, some major courses of some programs (ex. BSEd Mathematics; geometry, calculus, and statistics subjects, etc.) need computer laboratories. The ODOLC will serve as a computer laboratory for these courses.

The importance and necessity of digital and online learning can never be understated during the COVID pandemic. During the pandemic, the use of **digital and online media in the teaching and learning process became relevant**. It greatly facilitated the implementation of flexible learning [@CMO_4_20].

RA 11927 of 2022, also know as the Philippine Digital Workforce Competitiveness ACT, **promotes and supports the development of human resources that are equipped with digital skills and competencies that are comparable with global standards**. The CTE with the proposed ODOLC can greatly contribute to this cause. Graduates of CTE will be equipped with digital skills. These digitally competitive teachers will promote digital literacy in the basic education.
